    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you are looking for a refreshing and healthy drink, you should try apple juice. It is loaded with essential
        nutrients that can help keep you fit and healthy throughout the year. You can find bottled apple juice at
        stores, but it is half as healthy as homemade apple juice. This easy recipe for apple juice will help you
        prepare it at your home within 10 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Apples: Use red or green apples to make apple juice. Red apple is a little sweet, whereas green apple has a
            sour taste.</li>
        <li>Honey: You must add honey to apple juice to enhance its overall flavor and sweetness. However, if you want
            the drink without sugar, you can skip adding honey altogether.</li>
        <li>Lemon Juice: Lemon juice gives apple juice a nice tangy flavor.</li>
        <li>Water: Add water to the blender according to your desired consistency. If you want a thicker apple juice,
            then add less water. Conversely, if you want a thinner drink, then add more water.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the apples under running water.</li>
        <li>Cut the apples into 4 pieces. Remove the seeds of the apples.</li>
        <li>Add the pieces of apples to the blender along with water, lemon, ginger, and mint leaves. Run the machine.
        </li>
        <li>Pass the apple juice through a strainer.</li>
        <li>Add honey for taste.</li>
        <li>Add ice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
