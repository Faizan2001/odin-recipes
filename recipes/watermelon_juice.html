    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Watermelon juice couldn’t be easier to extract. You don’t need a fancy-schmancy juicer, just a blender.

        Scoop the watermelon into the blender, blend for about thirty seconds, and ta da! You’ve made watermelon juice.

        Taste your juice straight from the blender. If you like it as is, you don’t need to strain it.

        If your watermelon had seeds in it, or you want your juice to be less pulpy, pour it through a fine-mesh sieve
        into a pitcher. Easy!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small sweet watermelon (a 6 pounder will do)</li>
        <li>1 small lime, juiced (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the watermelon in half. Using a big spoon, scoop chunks of sweet watermelon into the blender. Discard
            the rind.</li>
        <li>Blend the watermelon until it is totally pulverized. This shouldn’t take more than a minute. For extra
            flavor, squeeze the juice of one small lime into the blender and blend for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>If your watermelon is notably pulpy or seeded, pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a pitcher.
            If not, you can pour it directly into glasses filled with ice. Watermelon juice will keep in the
            refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days. The juice will separate over time; stir it with a spoon to
            recombine.</li>
    </ol>
